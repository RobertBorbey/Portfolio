## About me

My name is Robert Borbey. I have a bachelor's degree in Exact Sciences - Computer Science and a master's degree in Informatics, both obtained at Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad, Romania. In the past 6 years I`ve worked in the financial and banking domain as an Insurance Operations Intermediary and in the end I figured out that I want to pursue a different path, which is the world of software testing. I have started my journey by participating in a 6 month course at ITFactory Romania, to learn the basics and develop my knowledge, since I have started from scratch. Currently I have finished the course of manual and automated testing and I will be taking the final exam in April 2024. On this website I would like to share some of my gained experience from personal studies and researches.
